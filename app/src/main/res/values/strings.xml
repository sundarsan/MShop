    <string name="small_description">It is made from dairy combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavours.</string>

    <string name="item_description">		It is usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and often combined
        with fruits or other ingredients and flavours. It is typically sweetened with sugar or sugar substitutes. Typically,
        flavourings and colourings are added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and
        cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth,
        semisolid foam that is solid at very low temperatures. It becomes more malleable as its temperature
        increases.
        The meaning of the phrase ice cream varies from one country to another. In some countries, such as the United
        States,applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative
        quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream.Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream
        are labelled instead. In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives,
        such as goats or sheeps milk, or milk substitutes e.g., soy milk or tofu, are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.
        Ice cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or in cones, which are licked. Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie.</string>
